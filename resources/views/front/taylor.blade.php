      <p>We start the process with our questionnaire, where through a few simple questions you can define us what your
        idea of travel is. In this survey we will try to define the essential features of your desired trip; the
        duration of the trip and at what time of year or date, the type of companions (partner, family, friends), if
        children are traveling or perhaps it is a romantic trip, if there is someone with reduced mobility among the
        passengers and, most importantly, the essence of your trip.</p>
      <p>We have defined up to four different types of trips, based on the nature of the tourist attractions to visit;
        cultural, leisure, gourmet and adventure. In any case, all the proposals include a base of different types of
        attractions, so that your trip does not become monotonous and boring, and it will always vary to your liking in
