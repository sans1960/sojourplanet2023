                inconvenience that may arise if these requests are not met. We
                appreciate your understanding and will do our best to ensure your needs are communicated clearly to

            <p class="open texto"> <span class="fw-bold">13.1.</span> When excursions and/or activities are booked and
                paid for in advance as part of your trip price and detailed in our
                booking confirmation, they are considered part of your package contract with us.</p>
            <p class="open texto"> <span class="fw-bold">13.2.</span> We commit to using reasonable skill and care in
                selecting suppliers to provide these excursions and activities, ensuring

                local suppliers or third parties after your trip begins are not part of
                your contract with us. These arrangements are solely between you and the supplier, governed by their
                terms. We are not
                liable for the performance, quality, or safety of these independently arranged activities. Exercise
                caution and consider
                the provider's reputation when booking additional services.</p>
